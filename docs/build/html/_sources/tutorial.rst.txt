Tutorial
================================
ECHO is used to inspect and combine drone data and receiver data from any telescope and radio receiver.

Reading in data
---------------
Data in ECHO consists of log files from the drone as well as efield or power data from the receiving instrument.

Working with sorties
--------------------
Any data used is organized into sorties. Sorties are the associated data from the drone flight and the received data during that flight.

Reading in beams
----------------
To further investigate an instrument's response during a sortie, it is helpful to look at the beam pattern of the instrument.
