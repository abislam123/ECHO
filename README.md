The External Calibrator for Hydrogen Arrays (ECHO) is a system for calibrating wide-field radio frequency arrays using a radio transmitter mounted on a drone.
Primarily targeting (but not exclusively limited to) arrays operating in the sub-GHz band targeting highly redshifted
21cm radiation from the early universe.

This repository contains software used to operate drone mounted calibrator sources and then collect and reduce the
resulting data.

ECHO is an open source project. Use and reuse is encouraged.  If you use this code in published work please reference the github repo.
