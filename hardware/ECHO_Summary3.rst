Welcome to ECHO's documentation!
================================
The External Calibrator for Hydrogen Arrays (ECHO) is a system for calibrating wide-field radio frequency arrays using a radio transmitter mounted on a drone. Primarily targeting (but not exclusively limited to) arrays operating in the sub-GHz band targeting highly redshifted 21cm radiation from the early universe.

This repository contains software used to operate drone mounted calibrator sources and then collect and reduce the resulting data.
